abstract: This study aims to analyze the effect of local government capacities on the improvement of air pollution. For this purpose, we construct a dynamic panel model using a data set for air pollutants such as SO2, CO2, and particulate matters and the local governments' capacities for Chinese Provinces in the period of 2007 - 2014. The results show that of the three types of capacities, the organizational capacity measured by environmental personnel, environmental expenditures, and average size of environmental institutions is very important, while the institutional capacity and social capacity have a insignificant impact on the air quality improvement. Among the local government capacities, other than the organizational capacity, only the activity of environmental organizations, which is a social capacity, partially affects the improvement of air pollution. Regarding local conditions, vertical dependence of financial resources, GRDP per capita, and population density have a negative impact on improving air pollution. These findings provide implications for local governments in China as to what capacities they should improve to improve air pollution.
