abstract: East Asian countries have followed the development process of a ‘developmental state’ characterized by economic growth through strong state policies and market intervention by the state. In this process, the city has grown in a compact way with a focus on the function and efficiency of space, and the problem of social inclusion has not been dealt with at the city level. However, it is expected that the specific aspects will be different due to the difference of development path of post-developmental state. The purpose of this study is to investigate how the limitations and characteristics of urban inclusivity faced by large cities in East Asia are related to the stage and characteristics of post-developmental states. For this purpose, urban inclusivity is divided into four dimensions-capability building, interdependence, participation, and spatial openness, and empirical analysis is conducted on 36 metropolitan cities in East Asia including South Korea, China, Japan, and Taiwan. The analysis results show that urban inclusion patterns are different according to developmental stages and characteristics. First, cities in the phase of post-developmental state such as Korea have high level of inclusivity in the dimensions of capability building and participation. Second, spatial openness is lower in China, where the state is in the middle of the developmental process, than in post-developmental states such as Korea and Japan. Within a country, it is low in cities with high levels of development. Finally, even if the system is moving to post developmentalism, if the crisis of national security and internal conflicts occur, the urban inclusivity in the dimension of interdependence can be reduced. These results provide important implications for understanding the causes of social exclusion in East Asian cities in relation to post developmental state’, a key feature of urbanization in the region, and how they have influenced urban inclusivity.
