abstract: This study analyzed 229 cities and counties in Korea using multiple regression models in order to examine the impact of social capital climate change vulnerability on a macro level. We initially used the entropy weight method to evaluate the climate change vulnerability index, then subsequently applied a multiple regression model. The results indicate that there is a large deviation in the level of climate change vulnerability which depends on spatial distribution. They also show that local social capital plays a positive role for reducing climate change risks. In particular, the neighboring network variables have the largest impact among social capital types in reducing climate change vulnerability. These findings suggest the need to establish and implement a location-based climate change response strategy around local residentsâ€™ social capital.
