abstract: Although it has been five years since the revised Housing Allowance System was implemented in Korea in 2015, there are few studies on the effectiveness of the policy reform. This study empirically analyzes the effects of the revised Housing Allowance System on the housing cost burden of renter households using propensity score matching combined with a dynamic panel data (PSM-DPD) model. For this, we use data from the Korea Welfare Panel Study from 2011 to 2017. The main analysis results are as follows. First, the revised Housing Allowance System had the positive effect of easing the housing cost burden for renter households who benefited from the new policy. Second, the new policy relaxed the housing cost burden for more households composed of only older adults, living in non-public rental housing, living above the minimum housing standard, or living in the Seoul metropolitan area. Third, the policy reform reduced the housing cost burden for multi-person households more than for single-person households. Overall, the new policy helped to equalize the housing cost burden across different groups of recipients. These findings suggest some policy implications for the continued expansion of the new housing allowance system in the future.
